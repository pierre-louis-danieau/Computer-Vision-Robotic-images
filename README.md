# Computer Vision : Object detection from robotic images

## 🎯 Introduction

Algorithm developed in the context of a post doctoral research work in a laboratory in Adélaïde, Australia during an internship of 5 months.
The code developed allowed a team of roboticists to autonomously dock an underwater robot from videos taken by the robots.

## 👨‍💻 Technologies used :
- Computer Vision / Machine Learning
- Python (OpenCV, scikit Learn)
- Filtre de Kalman
- Clustering (Kmeans & DBSCAN)
